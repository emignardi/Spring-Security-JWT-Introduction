# Spring Security w/ JWT Introduction (Authentication & Authorization)

This application was built as practice to become familiar with the Spring Framework and the Spring Security Project. Registration and Login implemented using In-Memory and Database users. Application security has been configured using SecurityFilterChain, UserDetailsService, AuthenticationProvider, PasswordEncoder, and more.
A JWT is generated when an existing user is authenticated and that token can be used for further authorization when accessing protected API's.
